# Using Qtcreator
## Deploy Qt5 application

There are three main ways to deploy a Qt5 application 
- Create native distribution packages that have dependencies on the distribution's Qt installation, 
- Create a self-contained application bundle that contains the application and everything the application needs to run that cannot be expected to be present on each target system
- Create an installer

This session will be about the third way
